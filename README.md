# Landing Page 2

This is the 2nd attempt to create a reposive and simple page. It's going to have a little bit of code but acts perfectly and smooth.

> Added previous experience of Landing Page

# Main

Font: "Roboto" by [google-fonts](fonts.google.com)

There are 3 sections on the page
 - left and right sections are empty space to grow
 - mid one is for the content of the webpage

## Header

The logo is in the written form, but soon it will be in original form. Other navigational links are not yet defined and replaced with some placeholders.

## Hero Text

The title, description, sign up button and image are all aligned in a split form. This information is used to showcase the website. And to quickly signup.
